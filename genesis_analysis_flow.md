# Genesis Task Analysis Flow - Detailed Breakdown

## 🔍 **How Genesis Analyzed "hi" Task**

### **Step 1: Task Analysis (`_analyze_task`)**
```python
# Genesis received: "hi"
# Analysis prompt sent to LLM:
"""
Analyze this task and determine:
1. What type of work is required?
2. What skills/knowledge are needed?
3. How complex is it?
4. Can it be handled by a single agent or needs coordination?

Task: hi

Respond with a JSON analysis.
"""
```

**LLM Response**: Basic greeting task, low complexity, single agent sufficient

### **Step 2: Strategy Determination (`_determine_strategy`)**
```python
# Strategy prompt sent to LLM:
"""
Based on this task analysis, determine the best strategy:

Task: hi
Analysis: [Previous analysis result]
Available agents: ['general_assistant', 'reasoning_assistant', 'research_assistant', 'writing_assistant', 'data_analyst', 'project_manager', 'creative_designer']

Determine:
1. Which agent(s) should handle this task?
2. Should multiple agents work together?
3. What's the execution order?
4. How should results be combined?

Respond with a JSON strategy.
"""
```

**LLM Response**:
```json
{
  "1_agents": ["general_assistant"],
  "2_multiple_agents": false,
  "3_execution_order": ["general_assistant"],
  "4_combination_method": "Not applicable (single agent handles the entire task directly)"
}
```

### **Step 3: Agent Selection (`_select_agent_for_task`)**
```python
# Heuristic analysis of "hi":
task_lower = "hi"
# No keywords matched for specialized agents
# Default: return first available agent
# Result: "general_assistant"
```

### **Step 4: Strategy Execution (`_execute_strategy`)**
```python
# Selected agent: "general_assistant"
# Delegated task to general_assistant
# Agent processed: "hi" → "Hi! How can I help you today?"
```

### **Step 5: Result Synthesis (`_synthesize_results`)**
```python
# Synthesis prompt:
"""
Synthesize these agent results into a comprehensive final response:

Original Task: hi
Agent Results: {"general_assistant": "Hi! How can I help you today?"}

Provide a clear, comprehensive response that addresses the original task.
"""
```

**Final Result**: "Hi! How can I help you today?"

## 🧠 **Genesis Decision-Making Process**

### **Available Agents**
Genesis has 7 specialized agents:
1. **general_assistant** - General purpose tasks
2. **reasoning_assistant** - Logic and problem solving
3. **research_assistant** - Information gathering
4. **writing_assistant** - Content creation
5. **data_analyst** - Data analysis
6. **project_manager** - Project planning
7. **creative_designer** - Creative tasks

### **Agent Selection Heuristics**
Genesis uses keyword matching to select agents:

```python
# Research tasks
if any(word in task_lower for word in ['research', 'search', 'find', 'investigate']):
    return 'research_assistant'

# Writing tasks  
elif any(word in task_lower for word in ['write', 'content', 'article', 'blog']):
    return 'writing_assistant'

# Data analysis
elif any(word in task_lower for word in ['analyze', 'data', 'statistics', 'metrics']):
    return 'data_analyst'

# Project management
elif any(word in task_lower for word in ['project', 'plan', 'manage', 'coordinate']):
    return 'project_manager'

# Creative tasks
elif any(word in task_lower for word in ['design', 'creative', 'brainstorm', 'innovate']):
    return 'creative_designer'

# Coding tasks
elif any(word in task_lower for word in ['code', 'program', 'debug', 'develop']):
    return 'reasoning_assistant'  # or coding agent

# Reasoning tasks
elif any(word in task_lower for word in ['reason', 'think', 'logic', 'solve']):
    return 'reasoning_assistant'

# Default fallback
else:
    return 'general_assistant'  # First available agent
```

### **For "hi" Task**
- **Keywords matched**: None
- **Selected agent**: `general_assistant` (default fallback)
- **Reasoning**: Simple greeting doesn't require specialized skills
- **Strategy**: Single agent, direct execution
- **Result**: Friendly greeting response

## 🔄 **Complete Flow Summary**

```
User Input: "hi"
    ↓
Genesis Analysis:
    ↓
Task Analysis (LLM): "Simple greeting, low complexity"
    ↓
Strategy Planning (LLM): "Use general_assistant, single agent"
    ↓
Agent Selection (Heuristic): "general_assistant" (default)
    ↓
Task Delegation: Send "hi" to general_assistant
    ↓
Agent Processing: "Hi! How can I help you today?"
    ↓
Result Synthesis (LLM): Final response
    ↓
Output: "Hi! How can I help you today?"
```

## 🎯 **Key Insights**

1. **Two-Stage LLM Analysis**: Genesis uses LLM for both task analysis and strategy planning
2. **Heuristic Fallback**: Keyword matching with default to general_assistant
3. **Single Agent Strategy**: Simple tasks use one agent, complex tasks can coordinate multiple
4. **Structured Responses**: LLM responses are JSON-formatted for consistency
5. **Comprehensive Synthesis**: Final results are synthesized for clarity

## 🚀 **For Complex Tasks**

For more complex tasks, Genesis would:
1. **Analyze complexity** and determine if multiple agents are needed
2. **Create coordination strategy** with execution order
3. **Delegate to multiple agents** in sequence or parallel
4. **Synthesize results** from all agents into comprehensive response
5. **Provide structured output** with strategy reasoning and final result
